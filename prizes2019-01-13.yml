    \  At TPP, we are revolutionising patient healthcare, both within the NHS and\
    \ across the world. To do this, our Software Developers are always looking at\
    \ improvements to our system and working on new ways to give patients more control\
    \ over their own care. This year we want to give you a chance to test your skills\
    \ by creating your own revolutionary design for the healthcare industry.  TPP\
    \ will be providing access to dummy patient data from SystmOne, one of the UK\u2019\
    s largest digital healthcare systems. You will be able to integrate with SystmOne,\
    \ retrieving patient data and booking appointments. Access will be available to\
    \ demographic data, appointment information, drug history, allergies and medical\
    \ sensitivities.  You will have free range to use this data, perhaps to develop\
    \ an app or piece of software that could be used to improve patient care. You\
    \ could create a revolutionary new appointment booking system or a personal healthcare\
    \ application- the possibilities are endless."
